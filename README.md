# Syslog Server and Client

This repository contains a syslog server and a syslog client program written Go.

The syslog server can accept syslog messages over UDP or TCP, and forward them to an upstream Syslog server. 
It can store received messages in compressed rotating files and supports anomaly detection via OpenAI-compatible LLM
which can be specified in environment variables: OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_URL, and OPENAI_MODEL before running
the syslog_server.go. There is a builtin web UI to view and filter the incoming logs.

A syslog client can send syslog messages over TCP and UDP. You can use a flag `-i` to pass in a file that has
many lines of syslog messages. A message will be sent per line.
